# Testings
Testing was done on the responsiveness of the website layout across the three main screen sizes used, utilizing a chrome "Width and Height" extension to test different resolutions. 
Testing was also performed on the pairs game itself, using chrome debug to seek out errors within my java script code, as well as interacting with the game to determine what the appropriate amount of "lives" were,  in order to code my desired difficulty.
## Findings
My findings were website responsiveness was remedied through media queries and that my *playerLives* was best set to ten.
